## How to use ?
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your Terminal.
3. Launch :
    - node sumCheck_v1.js -> the program will search the result of an addition, with two numbers in a given arrays.
    - node sumCheck_v2.js -> same goal with a more efficient algorithm.
    - node sumCheck_v3.js -> still same goal with an even more efficient algorithm.
4. Launch :
    - node sunsetSide_v1.js -> suppose you are given this numbers [53, 99, 41, 25, 52, 75, 41, 42, 19, 14, 20]. And now consider the numbers are buldings with n floors (53 = 53 floors, 14 = 14 floors, and so on.).
    And now, look at 99 and 75. Each of them has no greater number on its right (until the end of the array). So we consider 99 and 75 are buildings 'west-full-oriented'.
    => The program 'sunsetSide_v1.js' will determine all the buildings that are west-full-oriented in a given array.
    - node sunsetSide_v2.js -> same goal with a more efficient algorithm.
    - node sunsetSide_v3.js -> still same goal with an even more efficient algorithm.
